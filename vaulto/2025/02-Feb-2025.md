- Feedback
  - super professional, wonderful, absolutely happy
  - high ownership, very responsible, never gives up until results
  - even improving the devx, productivity tools
  - although 2.5 weeks only, so much work, so many improvements
  - great to meet in person
  - future: build connections, talk to people before big changes, slow down a bit, make smaller PRs
