* Demo: LD code refs, TTL + data-session, prog Okta login, Vite for CyCT, CSS modules (June, 2023)

<details><summary>Engineering demo details</summary>

### How to take advantage of [Code references](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/code/github-actions/?q=github) in LaunchDarkly for easier flag cleanup _(services & apps)_

Links LD web interface to source code, for easier tracking & removal of flags

 [Createa a yml and run on push](https://github.com/helloextend/client/blob/main/.github/workflows/ld-code-refs.yml), only needs LD_Project_Key & LD_Auth_token

 Once done, it shows up in [LD web interface > Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/portal/integrations).

For each flag, 2 sources of truth: [Code references](https://app.launchdarkly.com/portal/dev/features/servicing-integration-suite/code-refs) + IDE

 Filter dead flags: [filter LD flags without any code references](https://app.launchdarkly.com/portal/dev/features?codeReferences=false)

 Identify flags for removal

When to remove feature flags:

- It's been months
- The flag is On in production
- The flag's [Insights tab](https://app.launchdarkly.com/portal/production/features/servicers-list-optimizations/insights) shows less traffic

How to remove feature flags:

- We remove it from the code first ([example](https://app.launchdarkly.com/portal/dev/features/servicers-list-optimizations/code-refs))
- Then, we have to wait until our flag-removal-PR makes its way to Prod
- Finally, we can archive the flag

### How to use TTL (time to live) effectively with data session for faster e2e _(services & apps)_

TTL: no more need to clean up Stores, Products, Contracts, Conversations (thanks to Jesse!)

`data-session`: create them once & reuse everywhere

TLL & `data-session` are already in test package

No need to cleanup, & start using common session names with the `maybe` variant (check out [test-package-consumer repo](https://github.com/helloextend/test-package-consumer)):

![image-20230622133449717](/Users/murat/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20230622133449717.png)

(demo)

Results: [TTL tests on test package consumer](https://github.com/helloextend/test-package-consumer/pull/205), 10/44 tests use `data-session`, 10% faster in CI (7 parallel), 15% faster locally



### Programmatic login with Okta, using data session _(portal, maybe merchants)_

Login once, never repeat login.

[Preserves login state via `data-session` ](https://github.com/helloextend/client/blob/main/apps/portal/cypress/support/commands/okta-prog-login.ts#L83) given email+role combo

```ts
// as admin, with admin email
cy.progOktaLogin()

// customize it (similar to scopedToken from cypress-auth)
cy.progOktaLogin({
  role: 'superadmin',
  email: 'your email'
  url: '/admin/plans'
})
```

(demo)

### Vite pilot for Component Testing in Zen and Portal for 9x startup speed _(portal & zen)_

Problem: CyCT initial startup time gets slower as we do more `faker` things.

(For e2e, we took care of it with [esbuild preprocessor](https://helloextend.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1633386618/Improve+Cypress+e2e+test+latency+by+a+factor+of+20+Feb+2023) sped up startup by 20x this year)

```bash
# at Portal or Zen

yarn cy:open-ct # webpack
yarn cy:open-ct-vite # vite
```

With Vite we have 9x faster initial start

[known limitations](https://helloextend.atlassian.net/browse/DEVXTEST-1849): no mocking with `cy.stub` (FF tests), no `crypto` (Okta tests) - continuing collaboration with CyCT team

(video demo)

### [Css modules](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/6577) _(apps)_

`Object.assign` for CSS, allows to [compose css](https://github.com/helloextend/client/tree/ccb7fbf8fe215fcc12f777a7fb452aed7efe4426/packages/zen/src/components/css-modules-test)

Addresses 2 (future) problems with styled components - react server components & bundle size

Remember to add `"css.lint.validProperties": ["composes"]` to `settings.json` in VScode, or change the setting in your IDE of choice.
