### Problem: each e2e test takes 20 seconds to bundle before execution can start

### Solution effort 1 - leaner module and test plugin imports:

- [faker-js/faker -> @faker-js/faker/locale/en](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5565) at client - still desired at node-core
- [Cy plugin & config optimization - Portal](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5543), [Merchants](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5651), Customers - still desired everywhere else

- [Portal perf optimization part1](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5548)

- [Portal housekeeping: 1100 loc -> many files](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5612)

- [Merchants test latency optimization](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5681)

#### Results:

x2 gains; each e2e test takes ~10 seconds to bundle before execution can start

### Solution effort 2 - use an alternative bundler for e2e tests

- Lot's of discussion & collaboration with Cypress under issue [#25533](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25533#issuecomment-1438635446)
- [[DEVXTEST-1616] use esbuild for cy e2e test latency](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5770)
  - [Same PR for Merchants](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5784)
  - [Same PR for Customers](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5789)

#### Results:

Esbuild preprocessor gives us 10x test latency improvement.

- Local developer experience (videos):

```markdown
|       | plugin optimization | esbuild-preprocessor | test latency improvement        |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| App A | none                | yes                  | 20sec -> 2 sec, 10x improvement |
| App B | yes                 | none                 | 20sec -> 10 sec, 2x improvement |
| App C | yes                 | yes                  | 20sec -> 1 sec, 20x improvement |
```

- CI [before](https://github.com/helloextend/client/actions/runs/4207873450) [after](https://github.com/helloextend/client/actions/runs/4235371132), Cy cloud [before](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/r5mjf5/runs/6702/specs) [after](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/r5mjf5/runs/6716/specs?utm_source=github)

Conservative estimate: per CI run we are saving at least 20% feedback time and cost in CI minutes.

- Time & \$ ?

  Conservative estimate: over 100k e2e workflow runs per year ([client workflows](https://github.com/helloextend/client/actions/), [node-core workflows](https://github.com/helloextend/node-core/actions))

  Over 100 days of engineering time saved per year, 1000 days of CI minutes

### What do I do now?

Choice 1: wait ~6 months and track issue [#25928](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25928)

![image-20230224082406304](/Users/murat/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20230224082406304.png)

Choice 2:

- Take 6 minutes to read the blog post [Improve Cypress e2e test latency by a factor of 20!!](https://dev.to/muratkeremozcan/improve-cypress-e2e-test-latency-by-a-factor-of-20-34ce)

- Copy pasta the [PR for Customers](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5789) everywhere else.

  Estimate is 1 hour per app/service folder, including CI execution.

  Revert / opt out any time by commenting [out 1 line](https://github.com/helloextend/client/pull/5789/files#diff-d1336ebdd6377d5539a38b7ec507f9b1d233f24001c652e9ea267a14b122107fR20) (per deployment).
