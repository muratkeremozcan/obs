* [Resolved super weird install issue at node-core](https://github.com/helloextend/node-core/pull/15799/files)

  > a while ago we had a problem of installs taking long, we handled that with de-dupe afterwards
  > but, at the time it was thought that we should just blow away node modules in a script, and install only the things e2d tests needs for e2e jobs
  > This means, the e2e install is separate from package.json, [scripts/test-setup.js](https://github.com/helloextend/node-core/blob/master/scripts/test-setup.js) file gets versions dependencies that arenâ€™t controlled by package.jsonI pruned the dependencies that were choking, and that PR worked.TL, DR; [do this change](https://github.com/helloextend/node-core/pull/15799/files#diff-935199a4ad04ee41dc96422bdddb404283f2215d01673213a87f627f6c6e2511L31) over at your PR

* Resolved cryptic LaunchDarkly error : https://github.com/helloextend/orders-service/actions/runs/5501900509/jobs/10052335534?pr=210
  INFO: 2023/07/10 22:54:51 coderefs.go:148: sending 5255 code references across 309 flags and 434 files to LaunchDarkly for project(s): [ ***]
  [35](https://github.com/helloextend/orders-service/actions/runs/5501900509/jobs/10025803023?pr=210#step:4:36)

  when the code is sent to LD, it sends some extra lines, this is configured by `contextLines` which defaults to 2 in the [git hub action](https://github.com/launchdarkly/find-code-references)
  when looking at the code that references the FF at LD, it makes it easier to identify where it isline above
  line above
  the code we care about
  line below
  line belowWe can reduce that to 1 and try again

  ```yml
        - name: LaunchDarkly Code References
          uses: launchdarkly/find-code-references@v2.10.0
          with:
            accessToken: ${{ secrets.LAUNCH_DARKLY_AUTH_TOKEN}}
            projKey: ${{ secrets.LAUNCH_DARKLY_PROJECT_KEY }}
            # only send the code one line above and below to LD Code Refs (the default project with 300+ flags runs into a limit issue)
            # default is 2 if you leave it out; set it to your liking if you migrate out of the default project
            contextLines: 1
  ```
