## Which (1) Value was exemplified during H1 2022?
**• Win Together**

[Conditional branch protection for monorepos on Github](https://youtu.be/BFAou8IDTLQ) - _together we_ _reached industry standards in quality reinforcement_  

[Custom baseUrl in commit message](https://github.com/helloextend/gha-reusable-workflows/pull/13) - _addressed unique needs of services, so that they have a painless day-to-day experience despite long term efforts in the queue_ AI supported visual AI testing _- we took the opportunity to address a specific need for a team, while introducing an advanced but easy to use tool for everyone to take advantage of_   
**• Wow Every Customer**   
Email Testing - _it is at the foundation of our customer interactions, and we set the industry standard on how to test them effortlessly and effectively. Any engineering team that is involved with emails is testing emails and releasing confidently_   

**• Embrace Transparency and Earn Trust**  
The state of Continuous Deployment and how to make it better -  _we facilitated the communication, long term goals and immediate task planning between platform & product engineering in order to build our continuous deployment pipeline together._  


**• Think Big and Drive Change  
**[Onboarding bootcamp for API e2e testing](https://helloextend.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1354400102/Lesson+8+-+End+to+End+Testing)   - _we began to introduce and educate Extend's service engineering community on practical know-how about day-to-day quality testing tasks for the purpose of building building quality mindset and ownership._ 

**• We Each Control Our Destiny**  
GHA [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)  - _we learned and mastered new tech as soon as it became available, for the purpose of collating CI code common to apps & services in order to exponentially reduce CI maintenance, new CI configuration and the effort to introduce change._

## Which (1) Value had an area of improvement during H1 2022 and why?
**Embrace Transparency and Earn Trust  
**It took myself time to understand the details of our system from the perspectives of our engineering groups, their immediate pain points and future goals, so that I could help bridge the communication gap between platform engineering and product engineering in order to set targets and begin to build our continuous deployment pipeline together.

## What are 1-3 accomplishments completed in H1 2022 and what value did they add to Extend?
-   Improved Quality ownership (api onboarding bootcamp + test burn-in, suite trigger, flake & failure management utilities) - _educated the teams on practical testing, built_ _easy to master & impactful tools for the teams to improve the quality ownership_
-   Feature flag management, development, test patterns & strategies - _it is the future of Continuous Delivery, and are setting a trend in the industry on how to test & use them in the most optimal ways yet known_
-   Mentoring & knowledge sharing - _collaborated with & coached every SDET and any SWE interested in testing, so that they are equipped with the knowledge to not only fulfill their immediate needs but also to share information and reciprocate to their teams and the whole of engineering, in order to drive quality from bottom up._
