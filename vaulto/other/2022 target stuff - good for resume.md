## Which (1) Value was exemplified during H1 2022?
**• Win Together**

[Conditional branch protection for monorepos on Github](https://youtu.be/BFAou8IDTLQ) - _together we_ _reached industry standards in quality reinforcement_  

[Custom baseUrl in commit message](https://github.com/helloextend/gha-reusable-workflows/pull/13) - _addressed unique needs of services, so that they have a painless day-to-day experience despite long term efforts in the queue_ AI supported visual AI testing _- we took the opportunity to address a specific need for a team, while introducing an advanced but easy to use tool for everyone to take advantage of_   
**• Wow Every Customer**   
Email Testing - _it is at the foundation of our customer interactions, and we set the industry standard on how to test them effortlessly and effectively. Any engineering team that is involved with emails is testing emails and releasing confidently_   

**• Embrace Transparency and Earn Trust**  
The state of Continuous Deployment and how to make it better -  _we facilitated the communication, long term goals and immediate task planning between platform & product engineering in order to build our continuous deployment pipeline together._  


**• Think Big and Drive Change  
**[Onboarding bootcamp for API e2e testing](https://helloextend.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1354400102/Lesson+8+-+End+to+End+Testing)   - _we began to introduce and educate Extend's service engineering community on practical know-how about day-to-day quality testing tasks for the purpose of building building quality mindset and ownership._ 

**• We Each Control Our Destiny**  
GHA [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)  - _we learned and mastered new tech as soon as it became available, for the purpose of collating CI code common to apps & services in order to exponentially reduce CI maintenance, new CI configuration and the effort to introduce change._

## Which (1) Value had an area of improvement during H1 2022 and why?
**Embrace Transparency and Earn Trust  
**It took myself time to understand the details of our system from the perspectives of our engineering groups, their immediate pain points and future goals, so that I could help bridge the communication gap between platform engineering and product engineering in order to set targets and begin to build our continuous deployment pipeline together.

## What are 1-3 accomplishments completed in H1 2022 and what value did they add to Extend?
-   Improved Quality ownership (api onboarding bootcamp + test burn-in, suite trigger, flake & failure management utilities) - _educated the teams on practical testing, built_ _easy to master & impactful tools for the teams to improve the quality ownership_
-   Feature flag management, development, test patterns & strategies - _it is the future of Continuous Delivery, and are setting a trend in the industry on how to test & use them in the most optimal ways yet known_
-   Mentoring & knowledge sharing - _collaborated with & coached every SDET and any SWE interested in testing, so that they are equipped with the knowledge to not only fulfill their immediate needs but also to share information and reciprocate to their teams and the whole of engineering, in order to drive quality from bottom up._

## What are 1-3 areas of opportunity for H2 2022?
Component Test Driven Front end onboarding course

Cypress Component Testing

Poly repo & CD - GHA remote reusable workflows, pipeline setup, renovate, testing, 

## What are 1-3 goals for H2 2022?

Create our front-end onboarding course   
   
Migrate to Cypress 10 and roll out component testing   
   
Contribute to poly repo migration and continuous delivery efforts, build the new pipeline and test architecture in our new paradigm


--------
### Final 2022 targets

* Conditional branch protection for monorepos - quality reinforcement in CI

* Email Testing - important business need, we have wide-spread, effective testing for it

* Onboarding bootcamp for API e2e testing - new engineers learn advanced api e2e testing skills during onboarding

* GitHub Actions remote nested reusable workflows - hundreds of lines of yml code saved, hours of CI headache eliminated and abstracted away. Being used universally, and works out of the box with polyrepo.

* CI optimizations for polyrepo - optimized the CI architecture with parallelization and caching to achieve under 5 minute feedback on any PR. Implemented into the template, being used by migrated services.

* Test burn-in, suite trigger, flake & failure management utilities - educated the teams on practical testing, built easy to master & impactful tools for the teams to improve the quality ownership.

* Feature flag management, development, test patterns & strategies - it is the future of Continuous Delivery, and are setting a trend in the industry on how to test & use them in the most optimal ways yet known.

* Component testing for Zen component libraray - test universal components used in our apps as early and thoroughly as possible, eliminate duplicated test effort for the library consumers (over 90% code cov with Cypress component tests).

* AI supported visual AI testing - excellent fit for our Zen component library, combined with combinatorial testing methods gives us confidence in the thousands ways some of our visual components can be configured.

* The book CCTDD: Cypress Component Test Driven Design https://muratkerem.gitbook.io/cctdd/ : wrote a book to promote and teach component testing, presented in Cypress webcast and TestJS Summit conferences for publicity.

* 365+ Cy component test examples - created a reference repo for anyone wanting to experience and learn Cypress component testing.

* k6 test utils - innovated a pattern to re-use internal packages with k6, and created wrappers around domain entities to help load testing in any repo. All existing performance tests are being refactored to save on code duplication and effort. All future polyrepos will benefit from the package, scaling up. This saves hundreds of lines of performance test code, and hours of troubleshooting headache.

* k6 CI, environment, JS util libs, ts-check - innovated patterns to achieve local vs CI parity with performance test devex, and have some of the developer experience we are accustomed to with Node TS. Implemented it all into the k6-test-utils package, with thorough guides and documentation.

* Invented an optimization for the the e2e test performance problem of 20 second warmup times, reducing it to under 5 seconds. If the tests were already loading up fast, a few more seconds have been saved. Optimized the test plugins, educated the test team on how to use packages and plugins efficiently. Changes have been implemented in the monorepos, the services that have migrated to the polyrepo and the polyrepo template. Considering the amount of time saved for local development feedback times, CI feedback times and time of warmup up of each test in CI, the cost savings scale considerably.

* Mentoring & knowledge sharing - collaborated with & coached every SDET and any SWE interested in testing, or any of the above knowledge, so that they are equipped to not only fulfill their immediate needs but also to share information and reciprocate to their teams and the whole of engineering, in order to drive quality from bottom up.
