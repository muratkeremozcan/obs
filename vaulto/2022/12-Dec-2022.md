- Invented an optimization for the the e2e test performance problem of 20 second warmup times, reducing it to under 5 seconds. If the tests were already loading up fast, a few more seconds have been saved. Optimized the test plugins, educated the test team on how to use packages and plugins efficiently. Changes have been implemented in the monorepos, the services that have migrated to the polyrepo and the polyrepo template. Considering the amount of time saved for local development feedback times, CI feedback times and time of warmup up of each test in CI, the cost savings scale considerably. @testing
