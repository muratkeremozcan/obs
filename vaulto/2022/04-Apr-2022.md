  ## The state of Continious Deployment (CD) and how we might make it better

   ## Current

   ### Client

   *Client feature branches can run against `localhost:3000` in CI
   * Great DevX; **the feedback is near-instant locally, and 5-10 mins in CI**
   * Engineers can iterate and learn quickly

   **Lots of testing, confidence, ownership and satisfaction**

   * The only CD exists at client; **when merging a feature branch to `dev`**
   * There is no CD to acceptance, stage, prod
   * This is ok because higher deployments are much rarer (100 : 1)

   **Client is in acceptable shape, it can be better later**

   ### Node-core

   There is absolutely no continuous deployment on node-core

   **This makes it difficult to do the right things, and do things right**

   #### Good citizen workflow

   * new PR  
   * manually deploy to sandbox  
   * either by pushing code or other means, triggers an e2e test run

   **Sandbox is green, e2e tests work. Both PR and deployment are good**

   * merge PR to master  
   * manually deploy to dev, quickly so that e2e tests run against a valid deployment
   * maintain dev, so that others who need it do not maintain for you

   **You have matching master and dev deployment with green tests**

   #### Bad citizen workflow

   (aware or unaware)

   * open a PR, create new code, let e2e run against the sandbox with green
   * deploy to sandboxÂ  *(e2e ran against an invalid deployment)*
   * merge to master *(merging untested code to master)*
   * maybe deploy to dev or not *(usually a client engineer deploys for the service team, because the client needs the service)*

   **Untested code can go all the way up to production, effortlessly**

   ## What can we do?

   * Service independence - DevX

   * Research ways to give the same Client engineering experience to Node-core engineers
    * [Localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/feature-coverage/) has improved, it is paid for, we can talk to them
    * Ephemeral instances
    * Anything that resolves the **shared mutable state** problem of sandboxes


   * Figure out auto-deployment

    **Already doing some of it at Client**
    
    *feature branch -> dev*

   **These are are decoupled, complimentary efforts**

   ## Could be

   **Given** an independent service or app

   **When** the *deploy & test* duration is reduced to 5-10 mins

   **Then** changes can be released to production twice an hour

   *branch* -> *dev* -> *stage* -> *prod*
