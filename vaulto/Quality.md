# Quality
## Cost of Quality 

Prefer high confidence with low cost; less code giving good-enough confidence. 

Always think *"If A works, what are the chances B can fail?"* . If the answer is *"Low"*, then apply @risk-based-testing. In other words, there is a cost to quality; do not over-test and try to get away with minimal testing that gives enough release confidence. 

This graph explains it in another way.
