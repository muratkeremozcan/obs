## Dev
-   Testing, Engineering and the Scientific Method are all bound together. Engineering is about assuming stuff will go wrong and learn from that (then write tests) and predict the ways it might go wrong and defend against that (and write more tests).
-   There is a thin line between tech debt and feature debt. Tech debt is anything that impacts the engineering team. Lacking quality in tests is not tech debt, because it impacts customers. Period.
-   Story point estimates must account for development, testing, as well as documentation - whatever it takes to put that feature in front of the customer or the consumer API. Story pointing is an estimation of complexity; having to write tests does not change that because complexity is still the same. The **velocity** of the team will change and normalize over time. That is the real velocity of the team which fulfills an industry standard definition of done.
-   Writing tests and running them as you implement the feature will make your more productive
-   Shared mutable state is the source of all evil
-   However many tests you have, you can never prove your software is good. But one failing test means your software isn't good enough. Therefore use proven [[Test Methodologies]] to gain the highest confidence with the miminal investment.
-   Engineering is about learning, not already having all the answers. Good engineers optimize to be great at learning. You do that with short feedback cycles and iterating quickly.
-   Lean: maximum output with minimum work
-   You can't make a baby in a month with 9 women
-   As the [[quality]] of our system reduced, our ability to change it reduces too
-   The more you tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they give you. 
-   #Coverage is an assessment for the thoroughness or completeness of testing with respect to a model. Our model can be unit coverage, feature coverage, #mutation score, combinatorial coverage, non-functional requirement coverage, anything!
-   Pessimists sound smart, optimists make money
-   ... once battle-testing has defeated real-world issues and edge cases ...
-   ... trade offs that it made are no longer valuable
-   a test doesn't deliver value until it fails
*   Always look for opportunities to tweak what test is already existing as opposed to writing partially duplicated tests for new specs. The reason Cucumber / Gherkin is not great is this duplication; if every feature was mapped to a spec, there would be much duplication between the specs. What matters from a test perspective is the beginning state of a test; if reaching that state is common, then it is an opportunity for a test enhancement vs partial test duplication. At which point, the only caveat becomes the test duration for parallelization concerns.
* `this` keyword in JavaScript will burn you one day. Then it will burn you again and again and again. If Dante Alighieri were alive today, he would put writing object-oriented JavaScript among one of the first levels of Hell for sure. ![[Pasted image 20220316143024.png]]
