  - [cypress-auth](https://github.com/helloextend/cypress-auth)
  - [cypress-store](https://github.com/helloextend/cypress-store)
  - [cypress-product](https://github.com/helloextend/cypress-product)
  - [cypress-contract](https://github.com/helloextend/cypress-contract)
  - [cypress-claim](https://github.com/helloextend/cypress-claim)

    Subsequent packages test each other (auth > store > product > contract > claim) as a full system test.
    In addition all are being consumed and tested at [test-package-consumer](https://github.com/helloextend/test-package-consumer).

    You can view their statuses at Cypress Dashboard, those with prefix test-package/ , or at the repositories themselves via their badges.

    The repos are housekept by Renovate, updating all package versions (with the exception of node version, husky), also running nightly cron for badge updates.

    All test plugins have a few options when creating their relevant domain entities/objects, making them simple/approachable, and infinitely configurable.

    1. do not specify anything: random object generation that just works
    2. specify the full object yourself: always an option
    3. specify parts of the object: single property or any subset of the full object, the rest get auto generated.

    <br></br>  
    For object creation, you can and should prefer to use the *maybeCreate* variant where you can. It will work seamlessly and speed things up considerably. It should always be interchangeable and should be ok to mix and match them with plain versions.

  [test package consumer repo](https://github.com/helloextend/test-package-consumer) includes advanced copies of all the test plugin repos, slight variances are expected. Spok is being used for 100% assertions on the entirety of the object/entity.

  Furthermore, the maybe variants are sharing the session names; one `storeSession`, one `productSession`, one `contractSession`, one `claimSession`, all duplicated session names across the specs. The logic is smart enough to figure out if the entity is soft deleted, or never exists, activate or recreate if needed. There is no clash between subsequent or concurrent runs.

    Check out the execution times in the repo before vs after optimizing data-session, and see the test durations.

    We added 4 new spec files, all specs which use data-session share the same session names per domain. The total duration still went down by a few seconds.

    <https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/ch5ssh/runs/105/specs>

  

  We ran a test comparing the base and data-session variants. The speed increase was about 25 %.
