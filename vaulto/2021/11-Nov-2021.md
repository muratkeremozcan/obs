    > 1. We can use `cy.intercept` to stub network data, and instead of fixture as json files we have the option to use an array. This array can be achieved from `@helloextend/client-test-utils`. The advantages are that we do not have to have lengthy json files -no maintenance- and the data is dynamic every time we run the test.
    > 2. To set the products for the entire spec, we are taking advantage of an encapsulated function; IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) wrapping a function. The function returns the products, or any entity we like. We would not want to keep re-invoking the function -because it would generate new things- that is why we invoke it immediately and assign the values to an Object. After that initial setup, we can use that object however we like; i.e. `Object.values()` to make the values into an array and work with it.
    > 2. `stubLogin()` for when we do not need any backend manipulation from the UI client. There is a `generateUserAccessToken` fn in the utils we can take advantage of
